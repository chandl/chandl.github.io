                <h4>Software Engineer - Ashland, OR</h4>
                <p>
                    In October of 2018, during a re-org at Shasta Networks, I switched roles from an Integration Engineer to Software Engineer. With my role change, I took on a larger role in the project organization and development space, eventually leading a couple high-profile projects, <a href="#projects">described in more detail here.</a> 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    As a Software Engineer at Shasta Networks, some of my key accomplishments that I am most proud of are as follows: performed duties as the technical lead for two high-profile projects, coordinated the transition of most of my integration work to newhires, designed and implemented two products using the ELK stack, assisted with the planning and execution of a full-fledged infrastructure migration, presented a proposal for a hybrid microservice architecture in our existing environment, helped introduce AWS into our existing infrastructure, came up with the prompt for our first sponsored Hackathon, and mentored a coworker through a practicum project for college credit.

                <h4>Integration Engineer - Ashland, OR</h4>
                <p>
                    During my time as an Integration Engineer, I helped lead the implementation of hundreds of java-based HL7 routes from startup calls to production migrations. I acted as the main technical liaison between a large client, providing direct software support for creating, updating, and troubleshooting over 400 interfaces between a variety of source and destination health information systems, interface engines, and billing systems. In addition, I succintly documented all of the work that I performed for clients in JIRA and spent ample time creating documentation for new features and processes in Confluence.

                <p>
                    In addition, I played the following roles when Shasta was securing its infrastructure in order to obtain an initial HITRUST certification: implementation lead for 2FA and an internal certificate authority, implementation lead for LDAP and TLS into our existing applications, and security auditor for 40+ virutal and physical machines.

                <p>
                    I was promoted to the role of Senior Help Desk Technician as my tenure at the Help Desk grew longer and as I was able to demonstrate my technical knowledge. With the promotion, I was expected to be a leader for other help desk technicians and to provide support to the most difficult questions.

                    A typical day as a Help Desk Technician involved providing prompt responses to technology-related questions from students and staff. I troubleshot, diagnosed, and resolved problems relating to user accounts, the general operation of personal computers, and specific issues regarding programs and personal devices. Additionally, I meticulously documented incoming issues to create a log to be referenced by other technicians. I always tried to be a rockstar communicator while assisting others and actively tried to translate my technical knowledge into actionable direction for users.

                            As a Software Engineer at Shasta Networks, I was the technical lead on a project to create an inline healthcare data validation tool. I designed and implemented a Java application that utilizes the Elasticsearch (ELK) stack to visualize compliance and conformance details for real-time healthcare data.
