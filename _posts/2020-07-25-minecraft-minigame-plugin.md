description: "Minecraft is an enormously popular sandbox video game, which I have spent counteless hours playing throughout my childhood and still today. It was a major influence for me to start developing more, and provided me with great Java foundations that I still use to this day. This project is a server-side plugin that enables modular creation and exection of minigames in game."
