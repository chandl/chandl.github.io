description: "During my senior year at Southern Oregon University, I completed a capstone project to design and implement a livestreaming website similar to Twitch.tv. This was my first full-fledged application that I built and helped me learn about all of the aspects of the agile software development process. Read more to learn about my trials and tribulations of building a web service with little experience and how this project helped reinforce my knowledge of Waterfall and Agile development, software planning and requirement gathering, testing, web development, and MVC principles, among many other things."
