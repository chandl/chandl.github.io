description: "Gomoku is an abstract strategy game closely related to the ancient game of Go. It is greatly simplified compared to Go, making it a great game to explore concepts of adversarial AI with. In this school project, I created an adversarial AI agent that played Gomoku against other classmates. My agent ended up being the first place winner of our class tournament!"
