description: "In a set of five projects for my AI for Robotics class, I utilized and explored many of the algorithms that go into making a self-driving robot artificial intelligence. Read more to learn about the fascinating world of Kalman and Particle filters, A* search, PID controls, and SLAM algorithms for localizing and searching through stochastic and indeterminate environments.

I'm still working on getting everything set up on my website, please check back later for a full write-up about the fascinating world of Kalman and Particle filters, A* search, PID controls, and SLAM algorithms for localizing and searching through stochastic and indeterminate environments
