<p>
A typical day as a Help Desk Technician involved providing prompt responses to technology-related questions from students and staff. I troubleshot, diagnosed, and resolved problems 
relating to user accounts, the general operation of personal computers, and specific issues regarding programs and personal devices. 
Additionally, I meticulously documented incoming issues to create a log to be referenced by other technicians. 
I always tried to be a rockstar communicator while assisting others and actively tried to translate my technical knowledge into actionable direction for users.
