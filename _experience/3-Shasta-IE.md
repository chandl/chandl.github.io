<p>
During my time as an Integration Engineer, I helped lead the implementation of hundreds of java-based HL7 routes from startup calls to production migrations. 
I acted as a main technical liaison between a large client, providing direct software support for creating, updating, and troubleshooting over 400 interfaces 
between a variety of source and destination health information systems, interface engines, and billing systems. In addition, I succinctly documented all of 
the work that I performed for clients in issue tracking software and spent ample time creating documentation for new features and processes in our knowledgebase.
